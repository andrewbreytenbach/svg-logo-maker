# SVG Logo Maker

Create a personalized logo with ease using the Logo Generator CLI, a Node.js command-line application that generates an SVG file based on user input. Customize your logo with text, text color, shape, and shape color.

## About The Project
The Logo Generator CLI allows users to design a unique logo through a series of user prompts. It supports text up to three characters and offers color keywords and hexadecimal values for text and shape colors. Choose from three available shapes: circle, triangle, and square. The application generates a 300x200 pixel SVG image and saves it as a file named logo.svg. Additionally, the project uses Jest for running unit tests.
