# svg-logo-maker

To create a simple logo generator using JavaScript, you can use Node.js and some additional libraries. In this example, we'll use the inquirer, chalk, and fs libraries to prompt the user for input, create the SVG file, and save it to disk. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

Install Node.js if you haven't already: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Create a new folder for your project and navigate to it in the terminal.

Run npm init -y to create a package.json file.
Install the necessary libraries with npm install inquirer chalk.

Save the file and run the script using the command node logo-generator.js. You will be prompted to enter the required information. After providing the input, the logo.svg file will be generated in your project folder. Open the file in a browser to see the 300x200 pixel image matching the criteria you entered.
